# *BlenderFDS* code repository

This is the open user interface for [NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/), as an addon for [Blender](http://www.blender.org).

 * **Learn** how to use this tool on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/firetools/blenderfds/wiki).

The development of *BlenderFDS* is funded by a grant from the [Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation](https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/).
By the research project *WUIFI-21* (High fidelity computational fluid dynamics modeling of forest fires for Wildland-Urban Interface communities resilience and protection) the participating organizations intend to extend the capabilities of FDS on the prediction of wildland-urban interface fires propagation.
