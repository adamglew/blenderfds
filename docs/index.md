## What is NIST FDS? 

[NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/)
is a large-eddy simulation (LES) code for low-speed flows,
with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

## Based on [Blender](http://www.blender.org/)

BlenderFDS is developed in Python as an addon of Blender.

[Blender](http://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite.
It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline, BlenderFDS uses the modeling tools.

## Full control over the FDS input file

BlenderFDS let the user keep the exported FDS input file under full control,
while easying geometric data entry.
