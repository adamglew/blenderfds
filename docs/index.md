# Work in progress

# BlenderFDS is flexible.

The open user interface for the [NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/), a computational fluid dynamics model of fire-driven fluid flow.

# Full control over the FDS input file

BlenderFDS let the user keep the exported FDS input file under full control, while easying geometric data entry.

BlenderFDS is based on [Blender](http://www.blender.org/),
an open source 3D content creation suite.
