I am preparing the release of the new BlenderFDS for Blender 2.9x, ready for FDS 7.

The open user interface for the NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) [NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/).

 * **Learn** how to use BlenderFDS on the wiki pages, listed on the right.
 * **Discuss** about its usage on the [BlenderFDS discussion group](https://groups.google.com/g/blenderfds).
 * File **issues** on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/firetools/blenderfds/issues).
