## BlenderFDS is a [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) addon

BlenderFDS is developed in Python as a Blender addon.

[Blender](http://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite.
It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline, BlenderFDS uses the modeling tools.

## What is NIST FDS? 

[NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/)
is a large-eddy simulation (LES) code for low-speed flows,
with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

## Full control over the FDS input file

BlenderFDS let the user import and export the FDS input file, under full control,
while easying geometric data entry.

## Other open source tools for FDS

The [qgis2fds](https://github.com/firetools/qgis2fds/wiki) is a [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin to export terrains and landuse for wildfire simulation and atmospheric dispersion of fire pollutants.

## Funded by the WUIFI-21 project

The development of BlenderFDS is funded by a grant from
the [Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation](https://www.esteri.it/).

By the research project WUIFI-21 (High fidelity computational fluid dynamics modeling of forest fires for Wildland-Urban Interface communities resilience and protection) the participating organizations intend to extend the capabilities of FDS on the prediction of wildland-urban interface fires propagation.
