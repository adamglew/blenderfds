## BlenderFDS, full control over the FDS input file

BlenderFDS let the user import and export the FDS input file, under full user control,
while easying geometric data entry with powerful 3D editing tools.

BlenderFDS is developed in Python as a [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) addon,
and it is fully scriptable.

[Blender](http://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite.
It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline from modelling to visualisation,
and BlenderFDS makes use of its 3D modeling tools.

## What is FDS? 

[NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/)
is a large-eddy simulation (LES) code for low-speed flows,
with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

## Funded by the WUIFI-21 project

The development of BlenderFDS is funded by a grant from
the [Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation](https://www.esteri.it/).

## A family of open tools for FDS

[qgis2fds](https://github.com/firetools/qgis2fds/wiki) is an open [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin
that exports terrains and landuse for wildfire simulation and atmospheric dispersion of fire pollutants.
