## BlenderFDS is a [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) addon

BlenderFDS is developed in Python as a Blender addon.

[Blender](http://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite.
It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline, BlenderFDS uses its 3D modeling tools.

BlenderFDS let the user import and export the FDS input file, under full control,
while easying geometric data entry with powerful 3D editing tools.

## What is NIST FDS? 

[NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/)
is a large-eddy simulation (LES) code for low-speed flows,
with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

## Funded by the WUIFI-21 project

The development of BlenderFDS is funded by a grant from
the [Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation](https://www.esteri.it/).

By the research project WUIFI-21 (High fidelity computational fluid dynamics modeling of forest fires for Wildland-Urban Interface communities resilience and protection) the participating organizations intend to extend the capabilities of FDS on the prediction of wildland-urban interface fires propagation.

## Other open source tools for FDS

The [qgis2fds](https://github.com/firetools/qgis2fds/wiki) is a [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin to export terrains and landuse for wildfire simulation and atmospheric dispersion of fire pollutants.
